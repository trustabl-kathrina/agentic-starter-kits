# Simple Tool Calling Agent

</div>

---

## What this agent does

Tool-calling agent built with Langflow's visual flow builder. It calls external APIs as tools (weather forecasts,
national park data) and reasons over the results to answer user questions. Includes Langfuse v3 tracing out of the box.

**Example queries:**

- *"Can I go walking in Boston tomorrow at 3 PM?"*
- *"I want to go hiking near Denver this weekend. What day is best?"*
- *"Is it a good day for a picnic in San Francisco?"*

### Tools

| Tool                | API        | Description                                            |
|---------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Open-Meteo Forecast | Open-Meteo | Daily weather forecast (temp, wind, precipitation, UV) |
| NPS Search Parks    | NPS API    | Search national parks by state                         |
| NPS Park Alerts     | NPS API    | Active alerts and closures for a park                  |

> **Note:** Unlike other agents in this repo, Langflow agents do not deploy a custom container. The "agent" is a JSON
> flow definition imported into an existing Langflow instance. There is no Dockerfile, Helm chart, or FastAPI
> application.

## Prerequisites

- [Podman](https://podman.io/) + [podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) — for running the local
  stack
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and a bash-compatible shell — on Windows,
  use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (recommended)
  or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/install/)

### Installing Podman

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install podman             # install podman runtime
brew install podman-compose     # install compose plugin
podman machine init             # create a Linux VM (podman runs containers in a VM on macOS)
podman machine start            # start the VM
```

**Linux:**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y podman      # install podman runtime
uv pip install podman-compose   # install compose plugin
sudo systemctl start podman     # start the podman service
```

## Local Development

### Initiating base

Here you copy .env.example file into .env and generate Langfuse secrets

```bash
cd agents/langflow/templates/simple_tool_calling_agent
make init
```

### Setup Ollama

This will install ollama if it is not installed already. Then pull needed models for local work.
The default model is `qwen2.5:7b`. To use a different model, pass `MODEL=`:
`make ollama MODEL=llama3.1:8b`

```bash
make ollama
```

### Run OGX server

> **Keep this terminal open** – the server needs to keep running.
> You should see output indicating the server started on `http://localhost:8321`.

```bash
make ogx-server
```

### Run the Langflow stack

> **Keep this terminal open** – the stack needs to keep running.
> This starts Langflow + PostgreSQL + Langfuse v3 (ClickHouse, MinIO, Redis).

```bash
make run
```

> **macOS: If `make run` fails with `statfs ... init-db.sh: operation not permitted`:** your Podman machine may need
> rootful mode. This happens on some configurations where the VM cannot bind-mount host files in rootless mode. Run:
>
> ```bash
> podman machine stop
> podman machine set --rootful
> podman machine start
> make run
> ```
>
> Note: rootful mode reduces container isolation. If you want to revert after you're done working with this agent,
> run `podman machine set --rootful=false` — but you will need to set rootful mode again before running `make run`.

### Import the flow

1. Open <http://localhost:7860>
2. On the splash screen, drag and drop `flows/outdoor-activity-agent.json` into the import area — or click the
   **folder icon** to browse for the file
3. Alternatively, from the projects page, click the **+** icon and select the flow JSON to upload

### Configuration

Configure the flow components:

| Component        | Field      | Value                                     |
|------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| KServe vLLM      | api_base   | `http://host.containers.internal:8321/v1`   |
| KServe vLLM      | model_name | ollama/qwen2.5:7b                         |
| KServe vLLM      | api_key    | not-needed-for-local-development          |
| NPS Search Parks | api_key    | Get one free at `https://developer.nps.gov` |
| NPS Park Alerts  | api_key    | Same NPS key as above                     |

### Pointing to a locally hosted model

See [Local Development](../../../../docs/local-development.md) for Ollama + OGX setup for local model serving.

**Notes:**

- `api_base` — use `host.containers.internal` instead of `localhost` so containerized Langflow can reach OGX
  running on the host
- `api_key` — OGX doesn't require authentication, so any non-empty string works
- `model_name` — not all models handle tool calling well. `qwen2.5:7b` and `llama3.1:8b` are known to work

### Pointing to a remotely hosted model

Update the **KServe vLLM** component in the Langflow UI:

| Field      | Value                  |
|------------|------------------------|
| api_base   | your-model-endpoint/v1 |
| model_name | your-model-id          |
| api_key    | your-api-key           |

### Running the Agent

Run the agent from the Langflow UI by clicking the **Play** button.

### Tracing

Langfuse v3 tracing is included in the local stack and starts automatically. No additional setup needed.

- **Langfuse UI**: <http://localhost:3000>
- **Login**: `admin@langflow.local` / password auto-generated in `local/.env`

After running the agent, select the **Langflow Agent** project and click **Traces** to see agent executions — LLM calls,
tool invocations, inputs, and outputs.

### Stopping the stack

```bash
make stop        # stop services, keep data
make clean       # stop services, remove all data
```

| Data                                 | `make stop` | `make clean`                   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Imported Langflow flows              | Kept        | **Deleted** (re-import needed) |
| Langfuse traces (ClickHouse + MinIO) | Kept        | **Deleted**                    |
| PostgreSQL data                      | Kept        | **Deleted**                    |
| Redis cache                          | Kept        | **Deleted**                    |
| `local/.env` config                  | Kept        | **Deleted**                    |

## Deploying to Cluster

There is nothing to build or deploy — no Dockerfiles, no Helm charts, no k8s manifests. This agent assumes Langflow,
Langfuse, and an LLM (OGX/KServe) are already running on the cluster. You just import the flow JSON into the
existing Langflow instance and configure it.

### Login to OC

```bash
oc login -u "login" -p "password" https://super-link-to-cluster:111
```

### Finding cluster endpoints

Reach out to your cluster admin for the Langflow URL and OGX endpoint/model names. If you have `oc` CLI access,
you can find them yourself:

```bash
# Langflow UI URL
oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep langflow

# OGX URL
oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep ogx

# KServe model (internal endpoint + model name)
oc get inferenceservice --all-namespaces
```

### Steps

1. Open the Langflow UI on your cluster
2. Import `flows/outdoor-activity-agent.json`
3. Configure the flow components:
    - **KServe vLLM**: set `api_base` and `model_name`. You can connect through OGX or directly to KServe:

      | Option | api_base | model_name |
      |--------|----------|------------|
      | Via OGX (external route) | `https://<ogx-route-host>/v1` | vllm//mnt/models |
      | Via OGX (internal) | `http://ogx-service.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8321/v1` | vllm//mnt/models |
      | Direct to KServe (internal) | `http://<model>-predictor.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1` | /mnt/models |

      Use the external route if Langflow can't reach OGX internally (network policy). Use `oc get routes` and
      `oc get inferenceservice` to find the actual hostnames and namespaces.
    - **NPS Search Parks**: set `api_key` (get one free at <https://developer.nps.gov>)
    - **NPS Park Alerts**: set `api_key` (same NPS key)
4. Run the agent

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/v1/run/\<flow-id\>

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7860/api/v1/run/<flow-id> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input_value": "What is the best day to hike near Denver?", "output_type": "chat", "input_type": "chat"}'
```

Replace `<flow-id>` with the flow ID from the Langflow UI. You can find it in the browser URL bar when you open the
flow — e.g., `http://localhost:7860/flow/27e7203d-b2b1-4700-962a-144a66155f14` → the flow ID is
`27e7203d-b2b1-4700-962a-144a66155f14`.

On the cluster, replace `localhost:7860` with your cluster's Langflow route URL.

## Exporting Flows

When exporting a flow from Langflow, API keys and secrets can be embedded in the exported JSON file. To avoid leaking
secrets:

1. In the export dialog, **uncheck "Save with API keys"** — this excludes all API keys from the exported file
2. If you already exported with keys included, you can strip them manually by searching for `"api_key"` fields in the
   JSON and clearing their `"value"` entries

## Behavioral Tests

Behavioral tests validate tool selection accuracy, response quality, latency, and reliability against the live agent.
Tests are under `tests/behavioral/` and run from the **repo root** (test deps are in the root `pyproject.toml`).

```bash
cd /path/to/agentic-starter-kits

# Check tests are discovered (no env vars needed — flow_id validated at runtime)
uv run --extra test python -m pytest agents/langflow/templates/simple_tool_calling_agent/tests/behavioral/ --collect-only

# Run against live agent
LANGFLOW_TOOL_CALLING_AGENT_URL=<langflow-url> \
LANGFLOW_FLOW_ID=<flow-id> \
uv run --extra test python -m pytest agents/langflow/templates/simple_tool_calling_agent/tests/behavioral/ -v

# Exclude slow reliability tests
uv run --extra test python -m pytest agents/langflow/templates/simple_tool_calling_agent/tests/behavioral/ -v -m "not slow"
```

| Env var | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `LANGFLOW_TOOL_CALLING_AGENT_URL` | Langflow instance URL (default: `http://localhost:7860`) |
| `LANGFLOW_FLOW_ID` | **Required.** Flow ID — changes on re-import, discover via `GET /api/v1/flows/` |

**Differences from standard agents:**

- No MLflow enrichment — tool calls are extracted from Langflow response `content_blocks`
- Uses `api_format="langflow_run"` and `flow_id` in TaskConfig (harness adapter from RHAIENG-5389)
- No streaming support — always `stream=False`
- Lower thresholds than standard agents (smaller model + external API latency)
